# 🔐 Secure Development (Fullstack Boost)

While security is my core focus, I build secure applications using:

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

I implement:
- Secure authentication workflows  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Data encryption practices  
- Backend validation & API hardening

# 🧠 Security Philosophy

> “Assume breach. Monitor continuously. Harden aggressively.”

I build with the mindset that every system is a potential target — and resilience must be engineered, not assumed.
